# vue-dos-ui1
Example of nice VueJS UI experiment to create MS-DOS-like Single Page WebApp

# Description
This project is built using VueJS 2.0. The one-page web application simulating old programs in the style of the early 1990s (Microsoft MS-DOS, Turbo Vision) was created.

This app calculate of the factorial of integer numbers in range [0..150]. You should work with this app as with a typical program of the early 1990s with "text user interface". When you start it, you see Desktop (place for windows: help window, error window, data input and result window) and Hotkeys line at the bottom of the screen.

Font size and working windows size vary flexibly depending on the browser window size and the screen resolution (like the command line window, e.g. PowerShell or Cygwin terminal window).
